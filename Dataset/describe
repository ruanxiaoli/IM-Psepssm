The research of apoptosis proteins subcellular localization prediction can be traced back as early as 2003, when Zhou and Doctor 
constructed the first ZD98 apoptosis protein dataset, which contained 98 proteins classified into four compartments as cytoplasmic 
proteins, plasma membrane-bound proteins, mitochondrial proteins and other proteins, each class containing 43,30, 13and 12 proteins,
respectively. For ZD98 dataset, distribution of sequence identity percentage are 34.7, 30.6, 17.4 and 17.4% with ≤40%, 41%-80%, 
81%-90% and ≥91% sequence identity, respectively.Zhang constructed the second ZW225 apoptosis protein dataset in 2006, which contained 
225 proteins classified into four compartments as nuclear proteins, cytoplasmic proteins, mitochondrial proteins andmembrane proteins, 
each class containing 41, 70, 25 and 89 proteins, respectively. Chen and Li (2007a) constructed the third apoptosis protein dataset, 
named CL317, which contained 317 proteins classified into six compartments as cytoplasm proteins, mitochondrion proteins, nucleus 
proteins, membrane proteins, secreted proteins and endoplasmic reticulum proteins, each class containing 112, 34, 52, 55, 17, and 47 
proteins, respectively.
